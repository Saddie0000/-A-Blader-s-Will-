<p><b>The Begining</b></p>
<p>"The moment I was born, the world ended." Those very the very words that constantly 
whispered in my head, words that always echo in my mind, was the very gift that i truly needed; Destruction. 
My childhood was only a routine that cotains nothing but only an unfufilled destiny, to be the strongest "Blader",
that is. I've spent the majority of my time doing nothing but to train, learn and adapt to the conditions that I am
currently in. Aside from that I've also learnt to have a set of daily chores to acomplish every day, to not get lost in this sandbox
that im in. Not to mention I had no friends and all of my guardians(parents/relatives) are dead, I felt I was truly alone in this empty world, or was I?</p>
<p><b>Childhood</b></p>
<p>If i recall correctly, I was arround 4 years old when I gained consciousness about myself. I was confused at first but
one my guardians explained the reason of my existance to me clearly. I was never happy before, never once in this life I have felt this emotion called "Joy."
I lived in a small dojo, it was pruely made out of bamboo, straws and chisled wood. My guardians didn't know this but i could sense the barrier they've placed
arround the dojo, the main purpose of protecting me. At first I thought it was merely just to keep me from running away from the dojo, which i would have never
once thought of, but on that one fatefull day, April 14, 2009, that was the day I realised what was the purpose of that barrier.</p>
