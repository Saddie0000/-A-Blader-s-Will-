<p style=text-align:left><b>The Begining:</b></p>
<p style=text-align:left>"The moment I was born, the world ended." Those very the very words that constantly 
whispered in my head, words that always echo in my mind, was the very gift that i truly needed; Destruction. 
My childhood was only a routine that cotains nothing but only an unfufilled destiny, to be the strongest "Blader",
that is. I've spent the majority of my time doing nothing but to train, learn and adapt to the conditions that I am
currently in. Aside from that I've also learnt to have a set of daily chores to acomplish every day, to not get lost in this sandbox
that im in. Not to mention I had no friends and all of my guardians(parents/relatives) are dead, I felt I was truly alone in this empty world,
or was I?</p>
