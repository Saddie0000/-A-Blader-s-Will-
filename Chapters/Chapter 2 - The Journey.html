<h5>---Start of Chapter 2---</h5>
<h2>-Decision-</h2>
<p>I had two choices to make, either to start the journey now or get stronger before leaving the dojo.
In the end I decided to leave this place because I've already packed all my belongings and I'm not going to take them all out again.
Then I left the dojo or whatever reamins there, I went on walking straight because that would be my best option for now.
After walking non-stop that felt like a whole month, I've finally arrived at a small town, it was abandoned but I felt someone calling out to me.</p>
<h2>-The Voice-</h2>
<p>The voice I heard was not from the outside but from the inside, I closed my eyes and focused on that voice, "Wake Up."
I opened my eyes and everything around me was slightly red, I rubbed my eyes but apprently my eyes were glowing red.
I discovered that I also have imaginary powers, but I don't know how to use them.
Then I closed my eyes and try to concentrate energy into one spot and guess what, I formed a tiny ball of energy in my hands.
I dont know how I did that but the moment I lost focus the ball exploded but did no damage to me, unlike my surroundings.</p>
<h2>-Consealed Powers-</h2>
<p>I found some unusual stuff deep inside me, I could change the colour of my eyes and use some imaginary powers, but I was more intrested in finding a weapon that I could wield.
I gave up after seaching this wrecked town, I totally didn't blast it into pieces by accident.
After some time I decided to walk straight once again. Luckily I found another small town not far from the one I was in.
There were actually people in this town, I then went and inquired on where I could stay or rest for a short while.</p>
<h2>-Horrendous Huamns-</h2>
<p>The people in this town are simply stupid. Its either you get forced labour or overpriced places to stay, they wouldn't even allow me to stay if I didn't pay coins.
I left that town and gave a testemant about its downfall in the future, someone or something will make it happen.
Then some deamons suddenly spawn and ravanged that town, I was already far away from that town but I could still see demons ravaging there.
Showing no remorse I turned and walk straight once again.</p>
<h2>-Home-</h2>
<p>I found an abandoned hut, I chose not to abandon or destroy it this time. I then placed my belongings and cleaned up the hut that I will call home for now.</p>
