<h5>---Start of Chapter 1---</h5>
<h2>-The Beginning-</h2>
<p>"The moment I was born, the world ended."
Those very the very words that constantly whispered in my head, words that always echo in my mind, was the very gift that i truly needed; Destruction. 
My childhood was only a routine that contains nothing but an unfufilled destiny, to be the strongest "Blader", that is. 
I've spent the majority of my time doing nothing but to train, learn and adapt to the conditions that I am currently in.
Aside from that I've also learnt to have a set of daily chores to acomplish every day, to not get lost in this sandbox.
Not to mention I had no friends and all of my guardians(parents/relatives) are dead, I felt like I was truly alone in this empty world, or was I?</p>
<h2>-Childhood-</h2>
<p>If I recall correctly, I was arround four when I've gained consciousness about my existance.
I was confused at first but one my guardians explained the reason of my existance to me clearly. I was never happy before, never once in this life I have felt this emotion called "Joy."
I lived in a small dojo, it was pruely made out of bamboo, straws and chisled wood. My guardians didn't know this but I could sense the barrier they've placed around the dojo, the main purpose of protecting me.
At first I thought it was merely just to keep me from running away from the dojo, which I had never once thought of, but on that one fateful day, April 14, 2009, that was the day I realised the true purpose of that barrier.</p>
<h2>-Awakening-</h2>
<p>The fact that demons actaully existed in this world is already out of human logic, it was simply outrageous. The image of those demons was something you couldn't imagine. 
They took the form of a human and tranished their facial apperance, spikes and horns growing out of their face. They slaughthered all of the guardians who were trying to protect me, but in the end they all stood no chance.
I was just standing there watching all of them getting ripped apart from the inside, suddenly I remembered one thing, I wasn't truly alone.</p>
<h2>-Realisation-</h2>
<p>After the demons finally killed all of my guardians, they were having a party inside my room, I felt anger slowly taking over me, not because I was scared or about the fact that they were feasting on my guradians, but because they were sitting on my bed and rampaging all arround my room, messing everything up.
I went in and warned the demons that if they move an inch from their place they would die.
At first they were laughing loudly because they say that I was a child, but the moment they looked straight into my eyes, fear and confusion consumed their brains, which I don't think they even have any.</p>
<h2>-Retribution-</h2>
<p>You may ask why thise demons fear me? Well its simple, they are all weak.
I didn't realise I was this strong withdout any weapons or power, brute strength alone was already enough for me to tear them down one by one.
The demons were trembeling in fear to the point of not being able to move, was I, an ordinary four year old in their eyes, that intimidating to them? Well i couldn't care less at that moment, I was just focused on tearing them to literal shreds, this was my first retribution.</p>
<h2>-Aftermath-</h2>
<p>After whatever that was, the demons all fled, but they still died to the wounds I've inflicted on them, none of them had gotten out alive.
Then my rage left me, and I gained back my consciousness.
I was tired, so I cleaned up my room and slept on my bed, slowly recollecting moments that led me to this point.
After that well deserved break, I've come to a conclusion on why they we so afraid of me, that barrier was meant to seal me, keeping me away from the realities outside this sandbox I was in.
That means up to this point my guardian's duties weren't to protect me, but to enchain me to this place.
Then I've decided to roam this world to become the strongest "Blader", to fully utilize the talent that I was blessed with.
Oh and did I mention about my intrest and talents for swords/blades? Well I defeated every guradian that was protecting me with a wooden sword, when they were all still alive, of course.</p>
<h2>-Resolve-</h2>
<p>I decided to get out of this place, there was too many blood stains around my room that made the air reek like a grave.
Before leaving, I realeased all my guardians from this world, sending them to their next life.
After that I took all my belongings and I found something I shouldn't had found, it was a manual about imaginary powers, just like what my guardians had used to fight against the demons.
I threw the manual away because of how weak my guardians were even having those imaginary powers, or maybe they were just a bad example. After packing everything up, I needed to make a decision.</p>
